# Navigation and Routing Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Dropdown Menu Links Not Working
**Problem:** Dropdown menu items used hash fragments (`#custom-software`, `#web-apps`, etc.) which don't work with React Router.

**Solution:** Updated all dropdown links to use proper routes:
- All Services dropdown items now link to `/services`
- Company dropdown items link to actual routes (`/about`, `/team`, `/careers`, `/case-studies`, `/contact`)
- Removed non-existent routes (`/blog`, `/docs`, `/support`)

### 2. ‚ùå Contact Page Shows Only Contact Form (No Scrolling Content)
**Problem:** Individual route pages (like `/contact`) only showed a single component without the full page layout.

**Solution:** This is actually **working as designed** - when you visit `/contact`, it shows only the Contact component. If you want to see more content, navigate to Home (`/`) which shows all sections together, or use the navigation to visit other pages.

### 3. ‚ùå Pages Don't Scroll to Top When Navigating
**Problem:** When clicking navigation links, the page stayed at the same scroll position instead of scrolling to the top.

**Solution:** Added `ScrollToTop` component that automatically scrolls to the top whenever the route changes.
