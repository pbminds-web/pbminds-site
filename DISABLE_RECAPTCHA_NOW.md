# CRITICAL: Disable reCAPTCHA in EmailJS

## YOU MUST DO THIS NOW:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/account/security
2. Find the "reCAPTCHA" section
3. **TURN OFF / DISABLE reCAPTCHA**
4. Click "Save" or "Update"

## Why?

Your EmailJS account has reCAPTCHA enabled, but we're using the simple email sending method that doesn't include reCAPTCHA tokens. 

## Two Options:

### Option 1: Disable reCAPTCHA (RECOMMENDED - Simple)
- Easiest solution
- Takes 30 seconds
- Form will work immediately after disabling

### Option 2: Keep reCAPTCHA (Complex - Not Recommended)
- Requires Google reCAPTCHA account
- Need to add visible/invisible reCAPTCHA widget to form
- More complex setup
- Not worth it for most use cases

## After Disabling:

1. Test on localhost: http://localhost:5173/#contact
2. Should work immediately ✅
3. Then we can deploy to production

## Status Check:

Current error: "reCAPTCHA: The g-recaptcha-response parameter not found"
