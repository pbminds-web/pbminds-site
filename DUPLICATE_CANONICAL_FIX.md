# Fixing "Duplicate without user-selected canonical" Issue

## Problem
Google Search Console reported: **"Duplicate without user-selected canonical"**

This means Google found multiple versions of the same content and didn't know which version to index.

## Root Cause
The sitemap.xml included hash fragments (e.g., `#about`, `#services`) which Google treats as separate URLs from the main page, even though they load the same content.

Example of the problem:
- `https://pbmindstech.com/`
- `https://pbmindstech.com/#about`
- `https://pbmindstech.com/#services`

All these load the same HTML file but Google sees them as different pages, creating duplicates.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated sitemap.xml ✅
**Changed from:**
```xml
<loc>https://pbmindstech.com/#about</loc>
<loc>https://pbmindstech.com/#services</loc>
```

**Changed to:**
```xml
<loc>https://pbmindstech.com/about</loc>
<loc>https://pbmindstech.com/services</loc>
```

Now the sitemap only includes clean URLs without hash fragments.

### 2. Updated vercel.json ✅
Added:
- **Headers**: X-Robots-Tag for proper indexing
- **cleanUrls**: Removes .html extensions
- **trailingSlash**: Prevents duplicate URLs with/without trailing slashes

### 3. Added _headers file ✅
Created `public/_headers` to set canonical headers at the CDN level.

### 4. Existing Canonical Tag ✅
The index.html already has:
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://pbmindstech.com/" />
```

## How This Fixes the Issue

1. **Sitemap now only lists actual routes** - No more hash fragments
2. **Vercel enforces clean URLs** - Prevents URL variations
3. **Headers prevent duplicate indexing** - X-Robots-Tag tells crawlers how to handle pages
4. **Canonical tag in HTML** - Points to the authoritative version

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Resubmit Sitemap to Google Search Console
1. Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Click "Sitemaps" in the left sidebar
3. Remove the old sitemap if listed
4. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
5. Click "Submit"

### 2. Request Re-Indexing (Optional but Recommended)
1. Go to "URL Inspection" tool
2. Enter: `https://pbmindstech.com/`
3. Click "Request Indexing"
4. Repeat for other main pages:
   - `/services`
   - `/about`
   - `/contact`
   - `/case-studies`
   - `/careers`

### 3. Wait for Google to Process
- **Sitemap processing**: 1-24 hours
- **Duplicate issue resolution**: 1-2 weeks
- **Full re-indexing**: 2-4 weeks

Google needs time to:
1. Re-crawl your site
2. Remove duplicate entries
3. Update search index
4. Clear the error from Search Console

## Monitoring the Fix

### Check in Google Search Console:
1. Go to **"Pages"** section
2. Look for the error count to decrease
3. Check **"Coverage"** report for improvements
4. Monitor **"Index Coverage"** status

### What You Should See:
- ✅ Fewer pages reported as "Duplicate"
- ✅ More pages marked as "Valid"
- ✅ The error "Duplicate without user-selected canonical" should disappear

## Prevention

Going forward, make sure to:
- ✅ Never add hash fragments to sitemap.xml
- ✅ Use actual routes instead of hash navigation when possible
- ✅ Keep canonical URLs consistent
- ✅ Monitor Search Console regularly

## Verifying the Fix

### Test Sitemap Format:
1. Visit: https://pbmindstech.com/sitemap.xml
2. Verify no URLs contain `#` symbols
3. All URLs should be clean routes

### Test Headers:
1. Use browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Check response headers for `X-Robots-Tag`

## Support

If the error persists after 2 weeks:
1. Check Search Console for specific affected URLs
2. Verify canonical tags are correct
3. Ensure Vercel deployment is successful
4. Request manual re-indexing in Search Console
